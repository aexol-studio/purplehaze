<h2>What is generated?</h2>
<ul>
<li>when you type <strong>URL</strong> of an esmodule typings are fetched in the background and typings generated locally for intellisense</li>
<li>when you add <strong>Markdown</strong> files with gray matter it will generate typings for those</li>
<li>when you add a <strong>Page</strong> it will generate Route types so you won't make a mistake later when routing to another page</li>
<li>when you add <strong>GraphQL</strong> backends it will generate Zeus libraries for it making communication with GraphQL backend type safe</li>
<li>when you modify <strong>config</strong> you can access type safe values from it during build ssg process</li>
<li>when you add <strong>env variables</strong> you can access the record with all of them</li>
</ul>
